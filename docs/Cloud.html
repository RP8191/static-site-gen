<p>12 factor (https://12factor.net/codebase)</p>
<ol>
<li>codebase - one (version controlled) codebase per app. If apps share the codebase then move the common components to a common lib. </li>
<li>For example, Bundler for Ruby offers the Gemfile manifest format for dependency declaration and bundle exec for dependency isolation. In Python there are two separate tools for these steps – Pip is used for declaration and Virtualenv for isolation.</li>
<li>configuration - The twelve-factor app stores config in environment variables (often shortened to env vars or env). Env vars are easy to change between deploys without changing any code; unlike config files, there is little chance of them being checked into the code repo accidentally; and unlike custom config files, or other config mechanisms such as Java System Properties, they are a language- and OS-agnostic standard.</li>
<li>Backing Services - The code for a twelve-factor app makes no distinction between local and third party services. To the app, both are attached resources, accessed via a URL or other locator/credentials stored in the config. A deploy of the twelve-factor app should be able to swap out a local MySQL database with one managed by a third party (such as Amazon RDS) without any changes to the app’s code. Likewise, a local SMTP server could be swapped with a third-party SMTP service (such as Postmark) without code changes. In both cases, only the resource handle in the config needs to change.</li>
<li>Build-Release-Run - Keep these steps separate. i.e. you can not make changes to code at run time and expect it to propagated back to build stage. <em>common sense</em></li>
<li>Processes - execute using stateless processes which share nothing. The twelve-factor app never assumes that anything cached in memory or on disk will be available on a future request or job</li>
<li>Concurrency Twelve-factor app processes should never daemonize or write PID files. Instead, rely on the operating system’s process manager (such as systemd, a distributed process manager on a cloud platform, or a tool like Foreman in development) to manage output streams, respond to crashed processes, and handle user-initiated restarts and shutdowns.</li>
