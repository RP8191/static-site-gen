User said we need a map on the homepage of the project.
The product manager asked the development manager to implement the map control.
Development manager asked around and found out there is another team which already has a react control with the map implemented. 
Development manager asked the developer to implement the control.
Developer contacted the other team and found out that the control works with a newer version of react. The control had implement lot of functionality than needed by specific use-case. 
Developer started updating the entire application to make application compatible with the new control. The upgrade started throwing lot of incompatibility issues with the existing code base. Developer spent couple of days before reporting out with the issues he is running into. 
He would have been better off implementing the map directly as the requirement was to show just the map on the page. It did not need all the bells and whistles offered by the control. 
The issue in this case was the developer was "asked" to implement the control without much understanding of exact user requirement.
